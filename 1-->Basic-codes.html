<!-- Firstly, this is how to comment out a line in HTML -->

<!-- The Building blocks of all webpages are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. -->

<p> The Berlin Wall was destroyed on 9 November 1989. </p>

<!-- To write something, tags are used, like in the above code, the 'paragraph' tag is used.-->

<!--
<p> = Opening paragraph tag

</p> = Closing Paragraph tag 
-->



<!-- The 'br' tag helps us in breaking lines to move the next part to the next line. -->
<p> West germany and East Germany</p>
<p> West germany <br> and East Germany</p>
<!-- Similarly <nobr> is used to not break lines -->


<!-- The 'bold tag' (<b> and </b>) makes the text bold.-->
<p><b> Russian SFSR </b>(Soviet federation of Socialist Republic)</p>

<!-- Italic -->
<p><i> Russian SFSR </i>(Soviet federation of Socialist Republic)</p>

<!-- Emphasis -->
<p><em> Russian SFSR </em>(Soviet federation of Socialist Republic)</p> 

<!-- Strong -->
<p><strong> Russian SFSR </strong>(Soviet federation of Socialist Republic)</p> 

<!-- Underlined -->
